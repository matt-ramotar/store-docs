title: "Store"
description: "The core component of the Store library, managing data flow between network, memory cache, and local storage in your app."
---

## **Purpose of Store**

The `Store` serves as a mediator for your application's data flow. It provides efficient and consistent data management. Its primary purposes are:

- **Data Orchestration**: Manages the flow of data between the network, memory cache, and local storage ([SourceOfTruth](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/source-of-truth)).
- **Efficient Caching**: Handles in-memory and disk caching strategies to optimize data retrieval, reduce latency, and minimize unnecessary network requests.
- **Data Consistency**: Guarantees consistency across all local data sources by synchronizing updates and, if a [Validator](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/validator) is provided, ensuring that stale or invalid data is not served to consumers.
- **Flexible Validation**: Provides configurable validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and freshness according to your app's specific needs.

## **APIs**

### **Store**

[Store](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Store.kt) has the following structure:

```kotlin
interface Store<Key : Any, Output : Any> {
  fun stream(request: StoreReadRequest<Key>): Flow<StoreReadResponse<Output>>
  suspend fun clear(key: Key)
  suspend fun clearAll()
}
```

<ParamField path="Key" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the key used to identify the data item.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Output" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the domain data model representation of the item being
  retrieved.
</ParamField>

#### `stream`

A function that returns a [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) of [StoreReadResponse](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/StoreReadResponse.kt).

<ParamField path="request" type="StoreReadRequest<Key>" required>
  The request configuration for the data retrieval.
</ParamField>

#### `clear`

A function that clears the data item identified by the given key.

<Note>
  This method only removes data from the memory cache and source of truth. It
  will not update the remote data source.
</Note>

<ParamField path="key" type="Key" required>
  The key identifying the data item to be cleared.
</ParamField>

#### `clearAll`

A function that clears all data items.

<Note>
  This method only removes data from the memory cache and source of truth. It
  will not update the remote data source.
</Note>

## **Key Components**

The [RealStore](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/RealStore.kt) is the default implementation of the Store interface. It's composed of the following components:

1. **[FetcherController](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/FetcherController.kt)**: Responsible for efficient network operations.

   - Prevents duplicate network calls for the same data.
   - Shares responses among multiple requesters.
   - Manages network request lifecycles.

2. **[SourceOfTruthWithBarrier](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/SourceOfTruthWithBarrier.kt)**: Wraps the [SourceOfTruth](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/source-of-truth).

   - Synchronizes read and write operations.
   - Provides persistent data storage.
   - Maintains data consistency.

3. **Memory Cache**: Fast, temporary storage.

   - Provides quick data retrieval without hitting disk or network.
   - Reduces latency.
   - Automatically manages memory usage.

4. **[Converter](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/converter)**: Transforms data between network, local database, and domain data model types.

   - Facilitates data compatibility between different layers of the Store.

5. **[Validator](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/validator)**: Validates cached data to ensure it's still valid.

   - Prevents serving stale or invalid data to consumers.

## **Data Flow**

Here's how Store manages data flow through your app:

### **Reading Data**

<Steps>

<Step stepNumber="1" title="Memory Cache Check">

Checks if the requested data is present and valid in the in-memory cache.

```kotlin
val cachedToEmit = if (request.shouldSkipCache(CacheType.MEMORY)) {
    null
} else {
    val output: Output? = memCache?.getIfPresent(request.key)
    val isInvalid = output != null && validator?.isValid(output) == false
    when {
        output == null || isInvalid -> null
        else -> output
    }
}
```

<Steps>

<Step stepNumber="A" title="Validation">
  If data is found, it's validating using the
  [Validator](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/validator). If a
  [Validator](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/validator) is not
  provided, the data is considered valid.
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="B" title="Emission">
  Valid data is emitted immediately to the consumer.
</Step>

</Steps>

```kotlin
cachedToEmit?.let { it: Output ->
  emit(StoreReadResponse.Data(value = it, origin = StoreReadResponseOrigin.Cache))
}
```

</Step>

<Step stepNumber="2" title="Decide Data Source">

Determines whether to read from the [SourceOfTruth](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/source-of-truth), fetch from the network, or both. Emits `NoNewData` if neither [SourceOfTruth](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/source-of-truth) nor network fetch is requested.

```kotlin
if (sourceOfTruth == null && !request.fetch) {
  emit(StoreReadResponse.NoNewData(origin = StoreReadResponseOrigin.Cache))
  return@flow
}
```

</Step>

<Step stepNumber="3" title="Source of Truth Read">

If a [SourceOfTruth](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/source-of-truth) is configured and not skipped, attempts to read data from it.

```kotlin
if (request.fetch) {
  diskNetworkCombined(request, sourceOfTruth)
} else {
  sourceOfTruth.reader(request.key, diskLock).transform { response -> ... }
}
```

<Steps>

<Step stepNumber="A" title="Validation">
  If data is found, it's validating using the
  [Validator](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/validator). If a
  [Validator](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/validator) is not
  provided, the data is considered valid.
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="B" title="Emission">
  Valid data is emitted to the consumer.
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="C" title="Network Fetch Decision">
  If data is not found or invalid, decides whether to fetch from the network.
</Step>

</Steps>

</Step>

<Step stepNumber="4" title="Network Fetch">

If a network fetch is required, fetches data from the network.

```kotlin
val networkFlow = createNetworkFlow(request, networkLock)
```

<Note>
  The
  [FetcherController](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/FetcherController.kt)
  ensures only one network call per key.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="A" title="Data Handling">
  Fetched data is written to the
  [SourceOfTruth](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/source-of-truth) and
  memory cache.
</Step>

</Steps>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="5" title="Combine and Emit Data">

Combines the flows from the network and the source of truth to emit data in the correct order and origin to the subscribers.

```kotlin
emitAll(
  stream.transform { output: StoreReadResponse<Output> ->
    emit(output)
    // Update memory cache if needed
  },
)
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### Writing Data

While the Store primarily focuses on reading data, it provides an internal write method for updating data in the cache and [SourceOfTruth](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/source-of-truth).

<Steps>

<Step stepNumber="1" title="Update Memory Cache">

Updates the in-memory cache with the new data.

```kotlin
memCache?.put(key, value)
```

</Step>

<Step stepNumber="2" title="Update Source of Truth">

Writes the new data to the local storage (source of truth).

```kotlin
sourceOfTruth?.write(key, converter.fromOutputToLocal(value))
```

</Step>

<Step stepNumber="3" title="Error Handling">

Catches any exceptions during the write operation and returns the appropriate result.

```kotlin
catch (error: Throwable) {
  StoreDelegateWriteResult.Error.Exception(error)
}
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## **Best Practices**

- **Configure Memory Usage**: Set appropriate memory cache sizes based on device capabilities and data volume. Implement cache eviction policies that align with your app's data freshness requirements.
- **Implement Error Handling**: Define clear error recovery paths for network failures, cache misses, and data corruption. Use the [Fetcher](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/fetcher) retry mechanisms for transient network failures.
- **Ensure Data Consistency**: Set up the [Source Of Truth](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/source-of-truth) as the single source of truth for critical data. Implement validation rules that catch data inconsistencies early.
- **Optimize Network Usage**: Batch related requests where possible. Configure appropriate cache TTLs to minimize unnecessary network calls.
- **Monitor Performance**: Track cache hit rates, network request frequencies, and data refresh patterns. Adjust caching strategies based on real-world usage patterns.
- **Structure Keys Effectively**: Design cache keys that are both unique and logical, avoiding collisions while maintaining readability. Consider namespacing keys for different data types.
