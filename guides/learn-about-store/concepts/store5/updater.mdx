## **Purpose of the Updater**

The [Updater](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Updater.kt) is designed to handle data synchronization from the local Store to a remote data source. It provides:

- **Data Mutation Synchronization**: Ensures that any changes made locally are propagated to the remote data source.
- **Completion Handling**: Enables custom logic to be executed upon the completion of the network operation.

## **APIs**

### **Updater**

The [Updater](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Updater.kt) interface has the following structure:

```kotlin
interface Updater<Key : Any, Output : Any, Response : Any> {
    suspend fun post(key: Key, value: Output): UpdaterResult
    val onCompletion: OnUpdaterCompletion<Response>?
}
```

<ParamField path="Key" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the key used to identify the data to fetch. For example,
  if fetching a list of posts, this could be an `Int` representing the post ID.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Output" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the domain data model representation of the item being
  retrieved.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Response" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the response received after updating the remote data
  source.
</ParamField>

#### `post`

Makes a network request to update the remote data source with the provided data.

<ParamField path="key" type="Key" required>
  The unique key identifying the data item.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="value" type="Output" required>
  The data to be written, in the domain model format.
</ParamField>

#### `onCompletion`

An optional callback executed upon the completion of the network operation.

## **Data Flow**

### **Writing Data and Synchronization**

When a data mutation occurs in the lcoal Store, the [Updater](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Updater.kt) is invoked to synchronize the change with the remote data source.

<Steps>

<Step title="Local Mutation" stepNumber="1">
A write request is made to the Store, updating the local data.

```kotlin
val writeRequest = StoreWriteRequest.of(key, value)
mutableStore.write(writeRequest)
```

</Step>

<Step title="Queue Write Request" stepNumber="2">
  The write request is added to a per-key write request queue in the
  [RealMutableStore](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/RealMutableStore.kt).

```kotlin
addWriteRequestToQueue(writeRequest)
```

</Step>

<Step title="Update Local Store" stepNumber="3">
  The
  [RealMutableStore](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/RealMutableStore.kt)
  writes the new value to the local data source using a delegate
  [RealStore](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/RealStore.kt).

```kotlin
delegate.write(writeRequest.key, writeRequest.value)
```

</Step>

<Step title="Attempt Server Synchronization" stepNumber="4">
  The [Updater](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Updater.kt) attempts to post the latest value to the remote data source.

```kotlin
val updaterResult = updater.post(writeRequest.key, writeRequest.value)
```

</Step>

<Step title="Handle Updater Result" stepNumber="5">
  <Steps>

<Step title="Success" stepNumber="A">

- Updates the write request queue, removing processed requests.
- Clears any
  failed sync records from the
  [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt).

- Executes `onCompletion` callback if provided.

</Step>

<Step title="Failure" stepNumber="B">

- Records the failed attempt using the [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt).

- Leaves the write request in the queue for future retries.

</Step>
</Steps>
</Step>

<Step title="Emit Write Response" stepNumber="6">
  The [RealMutableStore](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/RealMutableStore.kt) emits a [StoreWriteResponse](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/StoreWriteResponse.kt) to consumers, indicating the success or failure of the write operation.

```kotlin
emit(storeWriteResponse)
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## **Best Practices**

- **Handle Updater Results Appropriately**: Use the `onCompletion` callback to perform actions based on success or failure.
- **Provide a Bookkeeper**: The [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) is responsible for recording failed sync attempts, allowing the [RealMutableStore](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/RealMutableStore.kt) to retry failed operations by invoking the `Updater` again.
