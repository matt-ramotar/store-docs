title: "Source of Truth"
description: "Single authoritative local data source, ensuring data consistency and enabling offline support."

## **Purpose of the Source of Truth**

The Source of Truth serves as the definitive local data source for your app. It provides:

- **Data Consistency**: Ensures that all parts of your application refer to a single, consistent data source.
- **Offline Support**: Enables your app to function without network connectivity by relying on locally persisted data.
- **Synchronization**: Bridges the gap between network data and local storage, ensuring that updates from the network are reflected in the local data source.
- **Observability**: Enables the Store to observe changes in the local data source and update consumers accordingly.

## **APIs**

### **SourceOfTruth**

[SourceOfTruth](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/SourceOfTruth.kt) has the following structure:

```kotlin
interface SourceOfTruth<Key : Any, Local : Any, Output : Any> {
    fun reader(key: Key): Flow<Output?>
    suspend fun write(key: Key, value: Local)
    suspend fun delete(key: Key)
    suspend fun deleteAll()
}
```

<ParamField path="Key" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the key used to identify the data item.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Local" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the local database model representation of the item
  being retrieved.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Output" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the domain data model representation of the item being
  retrieved.
</ParamField>

#### `reader`

Reads data from the local data source for a given key. Returns a cold [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) emitting the domain data model associated with the key.

<ParamField path="key" type="Key" required>
  The unique key identifying the data item to be retrieved.
</ParamField>

#### `write`

Writes data to the local data source for a given key.

<ParamField path="key" type="Key" required>
  The unique key identifying the data item.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="value" type="Local" required>
  The data to be written, in the local data source format.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  This method is used by
  [RealStore](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/RealStore.kt)
  to write data fetched from the network into local storage. It's also used by
  the [MutableStore](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/mutable-store) to
  optimistically update the local data source when a write request is received.
</Note>

#### `delete`

Deletes a specific data item from the local data source.

<ParamField path="key" type="Key" required>
  The unique key identifying the data item to be deleted.
</ParamField>

#### `deleteAll`

Deletes all data items from the local data source.

## **Data Flow**

### **Writing Data from [Fetcher](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/fetcher) to Source of Truth**

<Steps>
<Step title="Network Fetch" stepNumber="1">
The Store fetches data from the network using the [Fetcher](/guides/learn-about-store/concepts/store5/fetcher).

```kotlin
val networkData = fetcher.fetch(key)
```

</Step>

<Step title="Write to Source of Truth" stepNumber="2">
  The fetched data is written to the Source of Truth using the `write` method.

```kotlin
sourceOfTruth.write(key, networkData)
```

</Step>

<Step title="Notify Readers" stepNumber="3" >
  Any active reader observing the key is notified of the new data.
</Step>
</Steps>

### **Reading Data from Source of Truth**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Read" stepNumber="1">
    The consumer requests data from the Store.

    ```kotlin
    val request = StoreReadRequest.cached(key, refresh)
    val flow = store.stream(request)
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Source of Truth Reader" stepNumber="2">
    The Store invokes the `reader` method of the Source of Truth.

    ```kotlin
    val localDataFlow = sourceOfTruth.reader(key)
    ```

  </Step>

<Step title="Data Emission" stepNumber="3">
  The Source of Truth emits data through the
  [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/)
  returned by the `reader` method, which the Store passes to the consumer.
</Step>
</Steps>

## **Handling Write and Read Synchronization**

The Store uses a [SourceOfTruthWithBarrier](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/impl/SourceOfTruthWithBarrier.kt) to synchronize read and write operations. This prevents race conditions and ensures data consistency.

- **Barriers**: Implemented using [MutableStateFlow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-mutable-state-flow/) to block reads while a write is in progress.
- **Versioning**: Each read and write operation carries a version to coordinate updates accurately.

## **Best Practices**

- **Use Observable Storage When Possible**: Implement the `reader` method to return a [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) for real-time data updates.
- **Handle Exceptions Gracefully**: Ensure that exceptions are handled appropriately in both the `write` and `reader` methods.

- **Convert Between Data Types**: Ensure proper conversion between network, local, and domain data types.
