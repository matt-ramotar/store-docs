## **Purpose of the Converter**

The [Converter](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Converter.kt) serves as a bridge between different data representations. The Store uses the [Converter](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Converter.kt) to convert data between the network, local database, and domain models.

## **APIs**

### **Converter**

The [Converter](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Converter.kt) interface has the following structure:

```kotlin
interface Converter<Network : Any, Local : Any, Output : Any> {
    fun fromNetworkToLocal(network: Network): Local
    fun fromOutputToLocal(output: Output): Local
}
```

<ParamField path="Network" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the data fetched from the remote source. For example, if
  fetching a list of posts, this could be `List<Post>` representing the list
  of posts.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Local" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the local database model representation of the item
  being retrieved.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Output" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the domain data model representation of the item being
  retrieved.
</ParamField>

#### `fromNetworkToLocal`

Converts a network data model into a local data model suitable for storage.

<ParamField path="network" type="Network" required>
  The network data model to be converted.
</ParamField>

#### `fromOutputToLocal`

Converts a domain data model into a local data model suitable for storage.

<ParamField path="output" type="Output" required>
  The network data model to be converted.
</ParamField>
