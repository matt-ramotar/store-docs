title: "Bookkeeper"
description: "Designed to track local data changes that haven't been successfully synchronized with the remote data source. It plays a crucial role in conflict resolution, especially in applications that support offline operations or have intermittent network connectivity."

## **Relevant Context**

<Tip>
  Check out Google's [Offline
  First](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/offline-first)
  guide for more information on conflict resolution strategies.
</Tip>

Conflict resolution is critical when your app makes local changes while offline or when there are discrepancies between the client and server data. The [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) helps by:

- **Versioning**: Recording timestamps of failed syncs allows you to determine when changes occurred, which is essential for resolving conflicts.
- **Strategies**: Depending on your application's needs, you might implement different conflict resolution strategies. A common approach in mobile apps is "last write wins," where the most recent change overwrites previous ones.

## **Purpose of the Bookkeeper**

- **Tracking Failed Synchronizations**: The [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) records instances when local updates fail to sync with the remote source.
- **Conflict Resolution**: By keeping a record of failed syncs, the [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) enables the [Store](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Store.kt) to identify and resolve conflicts between local and remote data upon the next synchronization attempt.
- **Data Consistency**: Helps maintain consistency between the client's local data and the server's data by ensuring that unsynced changes are not forgotten and are eventually synchronized.

## **APIs**

### **Bookkeeper**

[Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) has the following structure:

```kotlin
interface Bookkeeper<Key : Any> {
    suspend fun getLastFailedSync(key: Key): Long?

    suspend fun setLastFailedSync(
        key: Key,
        timestamp: Long = now(),
    ): Boolean

    suspend fun clear(key: Key): Boolean

    suspend fun clearAll(): Boolean
}
```

<ParamField path="Key" type="Any" required>
  The type representing the key used to identify the data item.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="getLastFailedSync(key: Key)" type="Long?">
  Returns the timestamp of the last failed sync attempt for the given key.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  query="setLastFailedSync(key: Key, timestamp: Long = now())"
  type="Boolean"
>
  Records a failed sync attempt with the provided timestamp.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="clear(key: Key)" type="Boolean">
  Clears the record of failed syncs for the given key.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="clearAll()" type="Boolean">
  Clears all records of failed syncs.
</ParamField>

## **Data Flow**

<Steps>

<Step title="Local Changes Made" stepNumber="1">
  The application makes a local change that needs to be synced with the remote
  source.
</Step>

<Step title="Sync Attempt" stepNumber="2">
  The Store attempts to update the remote source using the
  [Updater](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Updater.kt).
</Step>

<Step title="Write Response Handling" stepNumber="3">
  - **On Success**: If the sync succeeds, the [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) clears any records of failed syncs for that key.
  - **On Failure**: If the sync fails, the [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) records the failure along with a timestamp.

  </Step>

<Step title="Conflict Resolution on Read" stepNumber="4">

- Before serving data, the
  [Store](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Store.kt)
  checks with the
  [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt)
  to see if there are any unsynced local changes.

- If there are failed syncs, the [Store](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Store.kt) attempts to resolve them before returning data.

</Step>

</Steps>

## **Implementing a Bookkeeper**

You can create a [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) using the `Bookkeeper.by` factory method:

```kotlin
val bookkeeper = Bookkeeper.by(
    getLastFailedSync = { key ->
        // Retrieve timestamp from storage
    },
    setLastFailedSync = { key, timestamp ->
        // Save timestamp to storage
        true
    },
    clear = { key ->
        // Remove entry from storage
        true
    },
    clearAll = {
        // Clear all entries from storage
        true
    }
)
```

### **Example**

From the [Trails](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Trails) app:

```kotlin
package org.mobilenativefoundation.trails.xplat.lib.market.post.impl.store

private fun createBookkeeper(): Bookkeeper<Int> =
  Bookkeeper.by(
      getLastFailedSync = { id ->
          trailsDatabase.postBookkeepingQueries
              .selectMostRecentFailedSync(id).executeAsOneOrNull()?.let { failedSync ->
                  timestampToEpochMilliseconds(timestamp = failedSync.timestamp)
              }
      },
      setLastFailedSync = { id, timestamp ->
          try {
              trailsDatabase.postBookkeepingQueries.insertFailedSync(
                  PostFailedSync(
                      post_id = id,
                      timestamp = epochMillisecondsToTimestamp(timestamp)
                  )
              )
              true
          } catch (e: SQLException) {
              // Handle the exception
              false
          }
      },
      clear = { id ->
          try {
              trailsDatabase.postBookkeepingQueries.clearByPostId(id)
              true
          } catch (e: SQLException) {
              // Handle the exception
              false
          }
      },
      clearAll = {
          try {
              trailsDatabase.postBookkeepingQueries.clearAll()
              true
          } catch (e: SQLException) {
              // Handle the exception
              false
          }
      }
  )
```

## **Best Practices**

- **Persistent Storage**: Use persistent storage (e.g., a local database) for the [Bookkeeper](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/blob/f9072fc59cc8bfe95cfe008cc8a9ce999301b242/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/mobilenativefoundation/store/store5/Bookkeeper.kt) to ensure that failed sync records are not lost between app sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure that exceptions are properly caught and handled when performing sync operations.
