title: Why Store?
---

Store is designed to simplify data management in modern applications. It provides an architecture for handling data flow between network, memory cache, and local storage, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and scalability.

## Unified and Efficient Data Management

Store acts as a single source of truth for your application's data, streamlining how you fetch, cache, and update data across different layers.
